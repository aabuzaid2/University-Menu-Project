# University-Menu-Project

//This project is meant to create a university menu for my university (AUC) to cover the basic tasks that need to be done.
//The main menu branches out into other menus such as course menu, section menu, and professor menu and allows you to manipulate stored content
//Extra added functionality includes the ability of extracting course information from a file, but only if it is correctly formatted, as well as being able to write information into a file.
//This project uses the vector STL
//The only issue I have detected with this project until now is that it fails to store inputted information which can easily be fixed by referencing a storage method in each function, I just did not get the oppurtinity to get to that issue due to university taking up most of my time
//The project was initially separated into multiple files but I had some issues with that which I intend to get to, but for now it is all in one file with a lot of comments to help readers differentiate.

//Thank you for you time and interest.
